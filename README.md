This test was challenging, but I was able to complete it despite having limited experience with the language. It was divided into two versions: v1, with a script that reads input from the terminal, and v2, which uses HTTP requests. Instructions are available in the README of each version. I appreciate the opportunity; it was very rewarding to complete this challenge.
