# Transdata Challenge

This challenge was tough, but I managed to complete it despite having limited experience with the language. It was divided into two versions:

- **v1**: A script that reads input from the terminal.
- **v2**: A version that uses HTTP requests.

Instructions are available in the README file of each version. I appreciate the opportunity; it was very rewarding to complete this challenge.
